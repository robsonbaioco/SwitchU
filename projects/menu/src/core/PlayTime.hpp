// afford a session of its own, a catalogue of a few hundred titles cannot.
// Blocks for one IPC round trip per title, so it belongs on a worker thread.
// A title whose query fails is logged and left out rather than failing the
// batch; the caller keeps whatever it knew about it before.

// Each query costs roughly a quarter of a second on hardware, so a full
// catalogue is half a minute of work. The menu drains its thread pool before
// handing the console to a game, which means a batch still running is time the
// player spends looking at a frozen launch animation -- so the caller passes a
// flag it can raise to stop the batch where it stands.
