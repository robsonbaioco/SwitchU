"""Write the newest CHANGELOG section into romfs, for the build to carry.

The Update tab shows what the installed version brought, and it has to do that
before any network call -- a console that never reaches GitHub still deserves an
answer. Deriving the file from CHANGELOG.md rather than keeping a second copy by
hand is deliberate: the review.json episode showed how quickly a hand-maintained
duplicate drifts from the thing it duplicates.

Run during release preparation, right after CHANGELOG.md gains its new section.
