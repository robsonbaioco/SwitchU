## Features

### The home menu

- A Wii U-style grid over an animated background, with pages, a configurable
  layout (3–8 columns, 2–5 rows) and drag-to-reorder edit mode.
- Games launch through a daemon that replaces qlaunch, so the menu is a real
  home menu: HOME returns to it, a suspended game resumes, and the console
  sleeps, restarts and shuts down from it.
- **A single-row view** on **−**: one large icon with its neighbours either
  side, the game's hero art filling the screen behind it and its logo above the
  row. It is a carousel — it wraps in both directions, skips empty slots, and
  repeats while ZL, ZR or the d-pad is held.
- Sorting on **R**: your own arrangement, A–Z, recently played, and **most
  played**, ordered by the play time the console itself records. In the most
  played view each icon carries its hours. The grid remembers the page you were
  on per title rather than per page number, so it lands in the right place after
  being rebuilt at a different width. The single-row view keeps your own
  arrangement instead, so R does nothing there.

### Folders

- Group software into folders with a name, a colour and their own pages. Games
  and homebrew mix freely.
- The tile shows up to nine of the icons inside it, on clear glass, in a grid
  that follows how many members there are.
- **+** on a title files it into a folder. Inside an open folder, **R** takes
  the focused title straight back out, and **↑** reaches the folder's name to
  rename it.

### Widgets

- Tiles that are not software: a clock, console and Joy-Con battery, the last
  game you played, recent playtime, a pinned image and a random screenshot.
- 1x1 and 2x1 sizes, placed and moved like any other tile.

### Per-game panel

Pressing **+** on a game opens its panel:

- **Details** — a dossier with the description, genre, developer, release date
  and reviews, fetched from a metadata service. Only for native applications;
  homebrew and ports get a smaller menu instead of an empty dossier.
- **Gallery** — covers and backgrounds from SteamGridDB, picked on the console
  and stored per game, independent of the theme.
- **Mods** — enables, disables and removes LayeredFS content under
  `atmosphere/contents/<titleId>`, one mod at a time rather than treating the
  whole folder as opaque.
- **Delete software** — removes the title *and* what it left on the card:
  `atmosphere/contents`, the older `atmosphere/titles`, the SX OS layout and the
  launcher's own artwork caches. The folders are named before you confirm, and a
  progress bar runs while they go. A port installed by hand is removed too,
  which the system's own uninstall leaves behind.

### Artwork

- SteamGridDB heroes and logos behind the menu, scanned for the whole library or
  chosen title by title.
- **No API key needed.** Searches, heroes and grids go through the service
  ncarvalho99 runs for the SwitchU forks. A personal key is still accepted and
  additionally unlocks logos.

### Themes

- Five tabs: **Installed**, **Static Themes**, **Animated Themes**, **Options**
  and **Update**.
- Animated themes are frame sequences compressed as BC1/BC7 and sampled by the
  GPU without unpacking, read a few frames per rendered frame so the menu opens
  immediately and the rest arrives while it is already in your hands.
- The catalogue says what each theme costs to download and what it occupies once
  unpacked, per theme and as a total, and marks the ones already installed.
- L and R turn the page anywhere in the catalogue.
- **Options** tunes the look directly: glass sharpness, background blur,
  background animation speed, grid columns and rows, menu music and volumes.
- Making one is a folder with a `theme.json` in it, copied to the card --
  colours, the drifting shapes behind the grid, a wallpaper, fonts, icons and
  sounds. [docs/themes.md](docs/themes.md) is the guide, and
  [docs/example-theme](docs/example-theme) a skeleton that works as it is.

### Settings

- **System** — SwitchU's own language, firmware and Atmosphère versions, EmuNAND
  state, nickname, timezone and clock sync.
- **Internet**, **Bluetooth** (real pairing and connection, not just a saved
  flag), **Audio**, **Display**, **Storage**, **Sleep** and **Controllers**,
  including a **controller test** for sticks, buttons and the touch screen.
- An **on-screen keyboard** for every text field, with accented characters, a
  symbols page and touch. The system keyboard cannot be used from a menu that
  runs as a library applet, so SwitchU draws its own.

### Updating itself

- The Update tab shows the installed version, what the last check found and what
  changed. The notes for the installed build ship with it, so the tab answers
  before it has spoken to anyone.
- GitHub is checked once a day, and there is a button to check immediately.
- An accepted update is downloaded, checked against the published size and
  inspected path by path; the daemon puts the files in place at the next boot,
  before the menu exists, because a running menu cannot replace the font and
  binaries it is holding open. **That first boot takes about half a minute
  longer.**

### Accessibility and languages

- Voice guidance through eSpeak NG, reading the focused item, its role and its
  position, with a configurable speech rate.
- Eight languages: English, Portuguese, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Dutch
  and Russian. Changing SwitchU's language applies immediately, without a
  restart, and is separate from the console's own setting.

## Installing

Download the archive from the [latest release](https://github.com/robsonbaioco/SwitchU/releases/latest)
and copy `atmosphere` and `switch` to the root of the microSD card, replacing
what is there. Restart the console.

Updating from an older build works the same way. Nothing is deleted that the
launcher does not own: your themes, artwork and settings live under
`config/SwitchU` and are left alone.

> **After updating Atmosphere or the firmware with a pack** (CNX Pack and the
> like), check that SwitchU still starts. Packs often wipe
> `atmosphere/contents`, and SwitchU replaces the HOME menu through a single file
> there, `atmosphere/contents/0100000000001000/exefs.nsp`. When that file is
> gone, the console boots into Nintendo's HOME menu and SwitchU Manager reports
> "SwitchU state unavailable". Open the Manager and choose **Repair
> installation** (from 2.5.7 on), or copy that one file from the release archive
> back to the card and restart.

## How to build

### Requirements

- [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started)
- [Xmake](https://xmake.io/#/)

### Clone

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/robsonbaioco/SwitchU
cd SwitchU
```

### Build (production daemon + external menu mode)

```bash
xmake f -p cross --toolchain=devkita64 --homebrew=n --backend=deko3d
xmake
```

### Build (homebrew .nro mode)

```bash
xmake f -p cross --toolchain=devkita64 --homebrew=y --backend=deko3d
xmake
```

### Clean

```bash
xmake clean
```

Build outputs are generated under `build/cross/aarch64/<mode>/`.

### Local Windows build with Docker

The reproducible local environment is defined in `tools/Dockerfile.build`; it
pins the devkitPro base image used to make SwitchU. After installing Docker
Desktop, create it once and then build the installable sysmodule archive:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\build-image.ps1 -PullBase
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\build-local.ps1 -Mode release -Variant sysmodule
```

The resulting archive is `artifacts/SwitchU-sysmodule-release.zip`. When the
Switch microSD card is connected, pass its drive letter with `-ConsoleDrive`
(`E:` by default): a successful sysmodule build copies `atmosphere` and `switch`
to it and verifies the main binaries by SHA-256. Use `-SkipConsoleDeploy` to
keep a build local. Read hardware logs directly with:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\read-console-logs.ps1
```

## Transition performance

Raw-tick hardware traces of launch and HOME-return can be summarized with
[`tools/analyze-transition-traces.ps1`](./tools/analyze-transition-traces.ps1).

## Known issues

As of 2.5.7. Each one is tracked as an issue with what is known so far and what
it would take to close it.

- **Parts of Settings are read-only or missing**
  ([#1](https://github.com/robsonbaioco/SwitchU/issues/1)). The timezone and the
  console language can be seen but not changed, and the TV audio format is saved
  without being applied until the next boot. Users, parental controls, data
  management, system update and the connection test are not there at all. There
  is no shortcut for them either: on a retail console the stock System Settings
  live inside the HOME menu that SwitchU replaces, so each one has to be built
  against its own system service.
- **Memory is tight with many sysmodules running**
  ([#2](https://github.com/robsonbaioco/SwitchU/issues/2)). The System pool,
  shared by every sysmodule on the card, sits at 221 of its 232 MB with about
  ten megabytes free, while the pool the menu itself runs in has hundreds free.
  Forty-four samples from a console over two days, docked and handheld, with and
  without a game running, put it at that same figure every time. So this is not
  something the menu can fix by using less; what is in SwitchU's hands is the
  daemon, which holds twelve of those megabytes -- eight of them a heap that
  read as nothing allocated in all forty-four samples. Quiet moments are not
  proof that the eight are spare, so 2.5.6 logs the heap's high-water mark as
  well, including right after an update is unpacked. Sizing the reservation
  against that figure is the next step. Meanwhile the System tab shows the
  pool's free space and the sysmodules started at boot, which is the place to
  look when a game fails to start.
- **Half of a Joy-Con pair cannot press anything.** A Joy-Con the console
  still holds as half of a pair is reported in its upright layout however you
  hold it, so a left one has a d-pad and a stick and no action buttons at all.
  The console's own menu behaves the same way. Register it as a player of its
  own in Change Grip/Order -- SL+SR -- and from 2.5.5 on it works held
  sideways, its four direction buttons standing in for A/B/X/Y.
- **Updating Atmosphere through a pack can switch SwitchU off.** Packs such as
  the CNX Pack clear `atmosphere/contents`, which removes the file that puts
  SwitchU in place of the HOME menu. The console then boots into Nintendo's HOME
  menu, and SwitchU Manager says the override was not found. From 2.5.7 on, the
  Manager offers **Repair installation**, which downloads the release you already
  have again and puts the file back. See [Installing](#installing).
- **A title with no name of its own shows its title id.** Some releases --
  downgraded builds in particular -- carry no usable name, and neither the
  console nor the artwork lookup can produce one. Rename the game from its
  dossier: the name then holds everywhere, and becomes the search term that lets
  SteamGridDB find it.
- **Rebuilding names and icons takes minutes.** Reading a title's name and icon
  from the console costs about a second, so a full library is a few minutes of
  work. Only "Rebuild names and icons" pays that; the ordinary reload does not.
- **Play time counts every profile on the console**, not only the one in use, so
  the figure on the grid can be larger than the one the system's own play
  activity shows for you.
- **A theme deleted before v1.1.0+fork.11 left its folder on the card**
  ([#3](https://github.com/robsonbaioco/SwitchU/issues/3)). That folder should
  come back in the Installed list and delete correctly now, which is still to be
  confirmed on a console. Folders left behind by an interrupted install are swept
  automatically from 2.5.2 on.

## Help me

If you want to help, open an issue when you find a bug and open a pull request
if you have a fix. Reports that come with the logs from `config/SwitchU` and,
when the console crashed, the files from `atmosphere/fatal_errors` and
`atmosphere/crash_reports`, are the ones that get fixed.
