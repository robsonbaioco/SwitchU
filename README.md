## Features

### The home menu

- A Wii U-style grid over an animated background, with pages, a configurable
  layout (3–8 columns, 2–5 rows) and drag-to-reorder edit mode.
- Games launch through a daemon that replaces qlaunch, so the menu is a real
  home menu: HOME returns to it, a suspended game resumes, and the console
  sleeps, restarts and shuts down from it.
- **A single-row view** on **−**: one large icon with its neighbours either
  side, the game's hero art filling the screen behind it and its logo above the
  row. It is a carousel — it wraps in both directions, skips empty slots, and
  repeats while ZL, ZR or the d-pad is held.
- Sorting on **R**: your own arrangement, A–Z, recently played, and **most
  played**, ordered by the play time the console itself records. In the most
  played view each icon carries its hours. The grid remembers the page you were
  on per title rather than per page number, so it lands in the right place after
  being rebuilt at a different width. The single-row view keeps your own
  arrangement instead, so R does nothing there.

### Folders

- Group software into folders with a name, a colour and their own pages. Games
  and homebrew mix freely.
- The tile shows up to nine of the icons inside it, on clear glass, in a grid
  that follows how many members there are.
- **+** on a title files it into a folder. Inside an open folder, **R** takes
  the focused title straight back out, and **↑** reaches the folder's name to
  rename it.

### Widgets

- Tiles that are not software: a clock, console and Joy-Con battery, the last
  game you played, recent playtime, a pinned image and a random screenshot.
- 1x1 and 2x1 sizes, placed and moved like any other tile.

### Per-game panel

Pressing **+** on a game opens its panel:

- **Details** — a dossier with the description, genre, developer, release date
  and reviews, fetched from a metadata service. Only for native applications;
  homebrew and ports get a smaller menu instead of an empty dossier.
- **Gallery** — covers and backgrounds from SteamGridDB, picked on the console
  and stored per game, independent of the theme.
- **Mods** — enables, disables and removes LayeredFS content under
  `atmosphere/contents/<titleId>`, one mod at a time rather than treating the
  whole folder as opaque.
- **Delete software** — removes the title *and* what it left on the card:
  `atmosphere/contents`, the older `atmosphere/titles`, the SX OS layout and the
  launcher's own artwork caches. The folders are named before you confirm, and a
  progress bar runs while they go. A port installed by hand is removed too,
  which the system's own uninstall leaves behind.

### Artwork

- SteamGridDB heroes and logos behind the menu, scanned for the whole library or
  chosen title by title.
- **No API key needed.** Searches, heroes and grids go through the service
  ncarvalho99 runs for the SwitchU forks. A personal key is still accepted and
  additionally unlocks logos.

### Themes

- Five tabs: **Installed**, **Static Themes**, **Animated Themes**, **Options**
  and **Update**.
- Animated themes are frame sequences compressed as BC1/BC7 and sampled by the
  GPU without unpacking, read a few frames per rendered frame so the menu opens
  immediately and the rest arrives while it is already in your hands.
- The catalogue says what each theme costs to download and what it occupies once
  unpacked, per theme and as a total, and marks the ones already installed.
- L and R turn the page anywhere in the catalogue.
- **Options** tunes the look directly: glass sharpness, background blur,
  background animation speed, grid columns and rows, menu music and volumes.

### Settings

- **System** — SwitchU's own language, firmware and Atmosphère versions, EmuNAND
  state, nickname, timezone and clock sync.
- **Internet**, **Bluetooth** (real pairing and connection, not just a saved
  flag), **Audio**, **Display**, **Storage**, **Sleep** and **Controllers**,
  including a **controller test** for sticks, buttons and the touch screen.
- An **on-screen keyboard** for every text field, with accented characters, a
  symbols page and touch. The system keyboard cannot be used from a menu that
  runs as a library applet, so SwitchU draws its own.

### Updating itself

- The Update tab shows the installed version, what the last check found and what
  changed. The notes for the installed build ship with it, so the tab answers
  before it has spoken to anyone.
- GitHub is checked once a day, and there is a button to check immediately.
- An accepted update is downloaded, checked against the published size and
  inspected path by path; the daemon puts the files in place at the next boot,
  before the menu exists, because a running menu cannot replace the font and
  binaries it is holding open. **That first boot takes about half a minute
  longer.**

### Accessibility and languages

- Voice guidance through eSpeak NG, reading the focused item, its role and its
  position, with a configurable speech rate.
- Eight languages: English, Portuguese, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Dutch
  and Russian. Changing SwitchU's language applies immediately, without a
  restart, and is separate from the console's own setting.

## Installing

Download the archive from the [latest release](https://github.com/robsonbaioco/SwitchU/releases/latest)
and copy `atmosphere` and `switch` to the root of the microSD card, replacing
what is there. Restart the console.

Updating from an older build works the same way. Nothing is deleted that the
launcher does not own: your themes, artwork and settings live under
`config/SwitchU` and are left alone.

## How to build

### Requirements

- [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started)
- [Xmake](https://xmake.io/#/)

### Clone

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/robsonbaioco/SwitchU
cd SwitchU
```

### Build (production daemon + external menu mode)

```bash
xmake f -p cross --toolchain=devkita64 --homebrew=n --backend=deko3d
xmake
```

### Build (homebrew .nro mode)

```bash
xmake f -p cross --toolchain=devkita64 --homebrew=y --backend=deko3d
xmake
```

### Clean

```bash
xmake clean
```

Build outputs are generated under `build/cross/aarch64/<mode>/`.

### Local Windows build with Docker

The reproducible local environment is defined in `tools/Dockerfile.build`; it
pins the devkitPro base image used to make SwitchU. After installing Docker
Desktop, create it once and then build the installable sysmodule archive:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\build-image.ps1 -PullBase
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\build-local.ps1 -Mode release -Variant sysmodule
```

The resulting archive is `artifacts/SwitchU-sysmodule-release.zip`. When the
Switch microSD card is connected, pass its drive letter with `-ConsoleDrive`
(`E:` by default): a successful sysmodule build copies `atmosphere` and `switch`
to it and verifies the main binaries by SHA-256. Use `-SkipConsoleDeploy` to
keep a build local. Read hardware logs directly with:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\read-console-logs.ps1
```

## Transition performance

Raw-tick hardware traces of launch and HOME-return can be summarized with
[`tools/analyze-transition-traces.ps1`](./tools/analyze-transition-traces.ps1).

## Known issues

- Some settings are still not implemented.
- Memory is tight with many sysmodules running. It has been reduced a good deal,
  but launching a game on a loaded console can still be unstable.
- A theme deleted before v1.1.0+fork.11 left its folder on the card. Those have
  to be removed by hand once; deletions from that version on free the space.

## Help me

If you want to help, open an issue when you find a bug and open a pull request
if you have a fix. Reports that come with the logs from `config/SwitchU` and,
when the console crashed, the files from `atmosphere/fatal_errors` and
`atmosphere/crash_reports`, are the ones that get fixed.
